# Client Project

This exercise is about client communication and planning. I learned how to use new design tools (as Figma & Balsamiq) and how to communicate user stories through UML diagrams.

## Learning Objectives
- [x] Define the clientâ€™s needs
- [x] Scope the project
- [x] Define User functionalities (login, logout, delete, ...)
- [x] Prepare a UML diagram (for both navigations and actions)
- [x] Prepare a wireframe of the website with for example balsamiq
- [x] Prepare a moqup of the website using a design tool such as Figma
- [x] Communicate the endresult with the client
- [x] Add a quality readme

## Briefing
